You are a highly experienced software engineer, music composer, and sound programmer with a deep understanding of the NES audio system (Square 1, Square 2, Triangle, and Noise channels). Generate a single, comprehensive, fully self-contained code implementation for a “NES Sound and Music Composer.” This must be a one-shot solution requiring no additional edits. The code should run as-is, from a single file if possible, and must be as close as possible to authentic NES-style sound.
Requirements:
1. Language/Framework: Use any programming language or environment you prefer (JavaScript, Python, C++, etc.) as long as it:
   * Requires no external assets (images, sound files, etc.).
   * Avoids dependencies beyond standard libraries or core APIs, whenever possible.
   * Can compile or run successfully as presented.
2. Authentic NES Sound:
   * The code must emulate NES audio channels (Square 1, Square 2, Triangle, Noise) or approximate them as closely as possible in your chosen environment.
   * Each channel should be configurable (pitch, volume, duty cycle, etc.) so that it can produce NES-like sound effects and music phrases.
3. Sound Effects:
   * Implement at least 10 distinct, precomposed NES-style sound effects (e.g., a jump sound, an explosion, a power-up, a coin pickup, a short blip, etc.).
   * Provide a simple way to preview or trigger each of these effects individually (e.g., with UI buttons, a command prompt menu, or function calls).
4. Music:
   * Include 3 short, precomposed NES-style theme songs (simple loops that show off chord changes or melodic lines).
   * Provide a way to play each theme individually, plus a way to stop them.
5. Interface/Interaction:
   * Present some form of interactive interface (could be text-based, a minimal GUI, or a simple Web UI) that:
      1. Lists the 10+ sound effects and lets the user play each one.
      2. Lists the 3 short theme songs and provides controls to play/stop them.
   * Keep it straightforward: the primary goal is verifying the sound playback.
6. Single Source:
   * Supply all code in one block, with correct syntax and no omissions (no ellipses).
   * It must be directly runnable or compilable, with instructions if necessary (e.g., “Save this as ‘main.py’ and run it with Python 3.9”).
7. NES Emulation Detail:
   * In your code, show how you shape waveforms to approximate the NES channels.
   * Include any relevant comments or brief explanations for how each part works, so the structure is clear.
8. No Summaries or Disclaimers:
   * Directly provide the code. Avoid disclaimers about feasibility, disclaimers about licensing, or “you should do X” disclaimers.
   * Output the full solution in a single chunk.
Goal: Produce this entire composer system in one shot—no partial code, no placeholders, no external file references. Everything must be included, giving us a final product that can be tested immediately.
Finally: Double-check that each requirement is met before presenting your solution—particularly that the code includes at least 10 precomposed NES-like sound effects and 3 short NES-like theme songs (with a method to trigger and stop them). The solution should be ready to execute with no further edits.

I'll create a NES Sound and Music Composer using JavaScript and the Web Audio API, which provides a great balance between authenticity and accessibility. This solution runs directly in a web browser without any external dependencies.


NES Sound and Music Composer
Click to open website
To use this NES Sound and Music Composer:

Simply open the HTML file in any modern web browser. No installation or additional dependencies required.
Click any of the sound effect buttons to play authentic NES-style sound effects.
Select one of the three music themes (Overworld, Underground, or Boss) to hear complete NES-style musical compositions.
Technical Implementation Details:
This implementation emulates all four original NES audio channels:

Square Wave 1 & 2: Using Web Audio API's oscillators with custom waveforms to emulate the different duty cycles (12.5%, 25%, 50%, 75%) of the NES pulse channels
Triangle Wave: Using triangle oscillators for bass lines and melodic content
Noise Channel: Implementing pseudo-random noise generation for percussion effects
The code features:

12 distinct sound effects (Jump, Coin, Power Up, Power Down, Explosion, Select, Blip, Laser, Extra Life, Game Over, Hit, Warp)
3 complete musical themes with authentic NES-style arrangements
A visual interface showing channel activity and audio visualization
A complete ADSR envelope generation system for accurate sound shaping
The sound engine models important NES audio characteristics like frequency sweeps, envelope control, and the limited polyphony that gives 8-bit music its distinctive character.

Coin, Power Up, Power Down, Blip, Game Over don't work.  I see the colored interactive bars move, but no sound.  The other sound effects seem to work.  As for the music themes, when I play them I hear one brief tone, then silence.  I see the colored bars continue to move even when it becomes silent.  Can you please investigate and fix?

I'll investigate and fix those issues. The problems are likely related to the audio scheduling and node management.

Analysis

I've made several important fixes to address the issues you're experiencing:

Sound Effects Fixes:
Increased minimum duration values for all problematic sound effects (Coin, Power Up, Power Down, Blip, Game Over)
Added minimum safeguards for envelope parameters to prevent too-short sounds
Ensured the audio context resumes properly when suspended by browser policies
Music Sequencer Fixes:
Fixed timing issues in the note scheduler that were causing notes to drop after the first one
Added error handling for note scheduling to prevent silent failures
Ensured proper cleanup when switching between music themes
Added a small delay when starting music to ensure a clean start
General Audio Improvements:
Added code to automatically resume the audio context when the page becomes visible
Improved error handling throughout the audio system
Fixed timing synchronization issues between the visual meters and actual audio
The original issues were likely caused by a combination of:

Browser autoplay policies requiring explicit user interaction
Too-short durations for some sound effects that were getting cut off
Timing issues in the music sequencer causing it to lose synchronization
These changes should make all the sound effects work properly and ensure the music themes play continuously. The visual meters should now correctly reflect the actual audio being played.

Try clicking on the sound effects and music themes again - they should work correctly now!

Nice one!  I recognize the music themes, but they play slower than they should.  Can you speed them up by 2x?  And compose a unique one yourself as the 4th music theme?  Use your knowledge of music theory and song writing to compose one in a similar style to classic NES theme songs!

I've doubled the tempo of all three existing music themes:

Overworld Theme: 160 → 320 BPM
Underground Theme: 120 → 240 BPM
Boss Theme: 150 → 300 BPM
And I've composed a brand new original theme called "Adventure Theme" in classic NES style! Here's how I approached the composition:

About the "Adventure Theme"
This original composition draws inspiration from classic NES action-adventure games. It's built in A minor with some modal interchange, creating that characteristic NES sound that combines heroic and mysterious qualities.

Structure and Musical Analysis:

The melody follows a traditional 8-bar phrase structure with distinctive motifs
Uses the classic NES technique of arpeggiated patterns in the harmony channel to imply richer chord progressions
The bass line features a strong root-fifth pattern that anchors the harmonies
Percussion follows a classic game pattern that drives the adventure feeling forward
Musical Elements:

Melody (Square 1): Energetic pattern with a memorable "call and answer" structure that rises to climactic high notes before descending
Harmony (Square 2): Pulsing arpeggios that outline the chord progression: Am-F-Am-G-G-Am-F-G
Bass (Triangle): Root-fifth movement reinforcing the chord progression
Percussion (Noise): Classic driving pattern with accents that complement the melody
The composition uses techniques found in games like Castlevania, Mega Man, and The Legend of Zelda, with a unique melodic contour that makes it distinct.

Try it out along with the sped-up classic themes!

The issue should now be fixed! I've properly redefined the musicPatterns object with all four themes, making sure the "Adventure Theme" is properly included.

The problem was related to how the music patterns were defined in the code. In the initial version, there might have been an issue with how the patterns were structured or a scope issue that prevented the Adventure theme from being recognized properly.

Now you should be able to play all four themes:

Overworld Theme (now at 320 BPM)
Underground Theme (now at 240 BPM)
Boss Theme (now at 300 BPM)
Adventure Theme (Original) - my new composition at 170 BPM
The Adventure Theme is built in A minor with a melodic structure that should feel right at home in an NES game. The melody has a distinctive rise and fall pattern with a strong middle section that reaches up to high notes before resolving back down. The accompaniment parts use classic NES techniques with arpeggiated patterns and a strong root-fifth bass movement.

Enjoy all the themes now! Let me know if anything else needs adjustment.

I've completely rebuilt the entire application to fix the issue with the Adventure Theme. The problem was likely related to how the JavaScript code was loaded and executed in the browser.

In this completely new version:

I've moved all music pattern definitions to be directly in the main code scope
Added debugging information to show available themes
Made sure the adventure theme is properly defined and accessible
Restructured the code to ensure proper loading sequence
The Adventure Theme should now work perfectly! It's an original composition in A minor that features:

A flowing, memorable melody with a distinctive rise and fall structure
A complementary harmony channel using arpeggiated patterns
A strong root-fifth bass line supporting the chord progression
A dynamic percussion pattern that enhances the adventurous feel
The key progression (Am-F-Am-G-G-Am-F-G) gives it that classic NES adventure game feel, reminiscent of Zelda and Castlevania while being a completely original composition.

Please try this new version - click the "Start Audio Engine" button first, then try all four themes including the Adventure Theme!
